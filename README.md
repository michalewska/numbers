# numbers

Numbers is a program that prompts a user to type a positive integer and prints all of the numbers from 1 up to and including the given number. Each number prints on a new line along with the word "even" or "odd" based on the printed number. 

For example:

The user input is 5, the program will then output the following:

  1 Odd
  2 Even
  3 Odd
  4 Even
  5 Odd
